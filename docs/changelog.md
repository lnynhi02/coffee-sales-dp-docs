| 2025-04-04 | v1.0    |         | - Completed the pipeline for the first time, wrote documentation, deployed it. <br> - Set up Kafka Connect for easier data loading. <br> - Used Airbyte for easier data extraction and loading with minimal coding. | - The Python script for generating coffee sales data needs to be run manually for now, which is a point for future improvement. <br> - Airbyte Cloud is running in full refresh mode instead of incremental, as I'm still figuring out how to implement it. |
